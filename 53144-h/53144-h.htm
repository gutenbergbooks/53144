<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Settled from remote times in the little town of Leigh, in Essex,
at the mouth of the Thames, the family of Haddock, we may be
sure, took early to the sea, as was befitting their name. There
are traces of Haddocks of Leigh to be found as far back as Edward
the Third’s days; but we need not search for earlier generations
than those which sprang from Richard Haddock, a captain in the
Parliamentary Navy. That the family had followed the sea from
father to son in bygone times, and had so established a tradition to
be observed by their descendants, might be argued from the regularity
with which the Haddocks of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries served in the Navy for upwards of a hundred years. This
regularity is only to be equalled by that with which they named
their children Richard, to the perpetual confusion of their biographers.</p>

<p>Captain Richard Haddock, to whom reference has been made
above, served under the Commonwealth. In 1642 we find him in
command of the ship Victory, and in 1652 he received a reward of
£40 for good service. He died in 1660 at the age of 79. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
eldest son William, also a Parliamentary captain, commanded the
ship America in 1650, and the Hannibal in 1653. He survived
his father only seven years, dying in 1667, aged 60. Captain
Richard Haddock had another son, Richard, who was probably
a good deal younger than his brother. He served with distinction
in the Dutch war in 1673;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and was in all probability the father
of William Haddock whom the family papers show to have been a
lieutenant in the Cornwall in 1696-1697, and who commanded a
ship in the action off Cape Passaro in 1718 (<a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>) and died in
1726.</p>

<p>William Haddock, the Parliamentary captain, had at least four
sons: Richard, Andrew, Joseph, and William. Richard will be
noticed presently. Andrew is mentioned in the first letter of this
Correspondence. William was at sea with his brother Richard in
1657 and 1658. Joseph was a lieutenant in the Lion in 1672, and
in the Royal Charles in 1673, and served in the Dutch war in those
years; and afterwards held a command in the East Indies, whence
he wrote an interesting letter here printed (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>). Richard
Haddock was born about the year 1629, and must have entered the
service at an early age; for in 1657, when the present Correspondence
begins, he was already a captain in command of the Dragon
frigate, which formed part of the squadron cruising off Dunkirk.
In 1666 he was captain of the Portland; but from 1667 to 1671<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
he appears to have temporarily left the Navy and engaged in
trading to the Mediterranean. On the breaking out of the Dutch
war, however, he was made captain of the Royal James, the ship
on which the ill-starred Earl of Sandwich hoisted his flag in the
battle of Southwold Bay. He was one of the few officers of that
vessel who survived the day, though he did not escape unwounded.
He next commanded the Lion; but early in 1673 he was appointed
to the Royal Charles, Prince Rupert’s ship, and within a few weeks
followed the Prince into the Royal Sovereign, when the bad
qualities of the former ship in action became evident. In July of
the same year he was made Commissioner of the Navy; and on the
3rd of July, 1675, he was knighted. In 1682 he was appointed to
the command of the Duke and to the chief command of ships of war
in the Thames and narrow seas; and in the next year became First
Commissioner of the Victualling Office. After the Revolution he
was named Comptroller of the Navy, which office he continued to
hold till his death, and received a pension of £500 a year. He was
one of the joint commanders-in-chief of the fleet in the expedition
to Ireland in 1690. He died on the 26th of January, 1715, in his
eighty-sixth year, and was buried in his native town of Leigh.</p>

<p>Sir Richard represented the borough of Shoreham in the parliament
of 1685-1687. He was twice married, his first wife being
named Lydia, probably a member of the family of Stevens, which
was settled at Leigh. The maiden name of his second wife Elizabeth
is unknown. He probably married her not earlier than 1670,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
when she was about twenty years of age, the inscription on her
tomb recording her death in 1709, at the age of 59.</p>

<p>Sir Richard appears to have had at the least six children, three
sons and three daughters. The sons were Richard, William, and
Nicholas. Of the daughters the name of only one, Elizabeth, has
survived, who married John Clarke, of Blake Hall in Bobbingworth,
co. Essex. Another daughter married a Lydell. The
third daughter died unmarried. William, apparently the second
son, died young. Richard and Nicholas both entered the Navy.</p>

<p>Richard, the eldest son, was, in 1692, fifth lieutenant of the
Duchess, and was present at the battle of La Hogue. He afterwards
served in the London, and in 1695 was in command of the
Rye. At the beginning of 1702 he received his commission as
captain of the Reserve, and in the following year succeeded to the
Swallow. In the latter ship he served with Sir George Rooke in
the Mediterranean. But in 1707 he had the misfortune to be
surprised by the French when convoying the Archangel merchant
fleet and to lose fifteen ships; and, although appointed to the
Resolution early in the following year, he seems to have soon
retired from active service. In 1734, however, he re-appears as
Comptroller of the Navy, and held the post for fifteen years, dying
at an advanced age in 1751. From the entries in Leigh parish
registers it seems that he was married thrice and had issue, none of
whom, however, survived him many years.</p>

<p>Of Nicholas, the youngest son of Sir Richard Haddock, we first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
catch sight in the following pages (<a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>) as distinguishing himself
at Vigo in 1702, and serving in Spain in 1706. In the following
year, on the 7th April, he received the command of the new ship
Ludlow Castle, being not yet twenty years old. At the battle of
Cape Passaro he fought his ship, the Grafton, with great gallantry;
and indeed at all times proved himself a very skilful and dashing
officer. He rose eventually to the rank of Admiral of the Blue,
and commanded the squadron sent into the Mediterranean to
overawe the Spaniards in 1738-1741. He returned to England
invalided and did not long survive, dying in 1746, aged 60.</p>

<p>About the year 1723 he purchased Wrotham Place, in Kent,
where he occasionally lived. He left three sons: Nicholas,
Richard, and Charles. The first died in 1781; Richard served in
the Navy; Charles was still living at Wrotham in 1792.</p>

<p>Here the male line of the Haddocks fails; and it is not necessary
to follow the family history further. A pedigree, which may be
found useful, is appended.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be seen that the letters and papers here printed belonged,
for the most part, to Sir Richard Haddock. His long life enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
him to embrace four adult generations in his correspondence. The
collection of documents from which they have been selected was
purchased by the Trustees of the British Museum in 1879, and now
forms the Egerton MSS. 2520-2532.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the Correspondence is so comparatively
scanty, for no doubt at one time the collection was a good deal
larger. From Nichols’s <i>Literary Anecdotes</i> (vol. v. p. 376) we
know that the Haddock papers were placed in the hands of Captain
William Locker, the Lieutenant-Governor of Greenwich Hospital,
who contemplated a publication of naval biography which was
carried out by Charnock in his <i>Biographia Navalis</i> from the same
materials. There is also evidence among the papers themselves, in
the form of a letter written by Charles Haddock in 1792, to
show that they were placed in Locker’s hands. The fate of
borrowed books and papers is a mournful one.</p>

<p>But, few as they are, a selection from the Haddock Papers has
been thought worthy to appear in print. As specimens of the letter-writing
of a seafaring family of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the letters have a value of their own, even apart from the
personal interest which they inspire as the record of long and
honourable service.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Hon</span>ᵈ <span class="smcap">Father</span>,</p>

<p>Sir, these I hope will congratulate yoʳ safe arrivall at Leghorne,
wᶜʰ God graunt may be with yoʳ health and well fare, for the continuation
whereof I shall ever pray.</p>

<p>I cannot yet forgett my unhapynes yᵗ soe short a tyme and small
distance hindred me the inioymᵗ of seeing yoᵘ before you gote out
yᵉ Channell, seeing I made it my aime and bussines to performe it,
but pleased God to frustrate me of my intended hapynes. I hope
yᵗ our next interview may be with the greater ioy and comfort.
Indeed, when I returned to Dover, which was the Sonday following
yoʳ departure, I was not a little greived when Major Genˡˡ Kelsey<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[b]</a>
tould me yᵉ unwellcome news of yoʳ being past by; and himselfe
was very sory when I gave him an accᵗ yᵗ I mett yoᵘ not, and tould
me, if I had in yᵉ least desired not to have gone for Zeinhead, he
would have ordered an other ship in oʳ roome. I was very thankfull
for his respect he exprest towards yoᵘ, but I knew not before yᵗ
I might be soe bould wᵗʰ him as to desire such a favor. Yoᵘ saild
hence yᵉ Fryday evening; and Satuarday, by 10 in yᵉ forenoone,
we were soe neare yᵉ head of Beachy yᵗ noe shipp could or did passe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by us, but we spake wᵗʰ in hopes of meeting yoᵘ. Surely the wind
blew the harder to deny me yᵗ hapynes. God in mercy goe alongst
with yoᵘ and preserve yoᵘ from the rage of unreasonable men. I
shall not be wanting, as I am bound in duty, to make it my earnest
request to God for yoʳ preservation. My wife, in good health,
presents her humble duty to yoᵘ, and hath ever since bine very sorrowfull
she stayed not behind to present her duty and respects to
yoᵘ at yoʳ departure.</p>

<p>Sir, litle of novelty ofers at present, only of great preparations for
yᵉ fitting out seavrall great shipps, as yᵉ Resolution, Naiesby, and
Andrew, from Portsmᵒ; yᵉ Tryomph, Victory, Vantguard, and
Entrance, from Chatham. I cannot give you an accᵗ, yᵉ occasion or
upon wᵗ designe yᵉ shipps are prepared; only suppose it may be to
be in a readynes to defend our selves if any treachorus act should be
ofered by the Hollander, who will have 70 saile men of warr out
very sodainely, as is certainely reported. I hope noe act of hostillity
against us is intended. We have iust cause to feare yᵉ worst; and I
think, as farr as I am able to aprehend, yoᵘ will have little occasion
to trust or put any confidence in them abroad. God send us peace
at home and abroad; but, if these faile us, peace wᵗʰ God will beare
up our spirits in the greatest dificulties yᵗ doe atend our earthly
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Sir, my wife desires yoᵘ please, at yoʳ arrivall at Venᵃ, to buy for
her a foiled stone of the measure I conseave was given by her sisters
to Brother Andrew at Leigh; as alsoe a pott ketle and 2 stue panns,
one lesser than the other; as alsoe a jarr from Leghorne, with wᵗ
other things nessesary for a howse, to yᵉ value of £3 in fower pound
in all, which shall be thankfully repayed. I intend to wright yoᵘ
to Venᵃ, when [I] conseave you may ataine thither, and what ofers
shall not be wanting of advizeing yoᵘ.</p>

<p>Sʳ, my most humble duty wᵗʰ Bro. Wms. presented unto you wᵗʰ

But they want not harbours in Holland to secure them and wᵗ they
ketch from us. I conseave yoᵘ want not letters of caution from yoʳ
owners to be carefull of trusting the Hollanders. I feare they will
prove treacherous to there ingagemᵗˢ wᵗʰ us in the peace agreed
betwixt us. They are almost ready to saile wᵗʰ 50 or upward men
of warr, besides 16 saile now in or Channell. My Lord Protector is
not wanting to prevent there treacherous actions, if any intended
against us. I conseave in 14 dayes we may have upwards of 40
saile, considerable men of warr, in the Downes, to answer any atempt
may be ofered by them; and doe beleive both we and the squadron
before Ostend may be called of, as soone as we have any intelligence
of there redynes to saile.</p>

<p>Sʳ, my most humble duty presented unto yoᵘ wᵗʰ my deare Mother,

whome I gave leave to goe to London; wᶜʰ hope is safely arrived
with you. Since wᶜʰ, litle of acction here in these parts. The
21 instant, about midnight, heere escaped out a small pickeron of
4 or 6 guns out this haboʳ, notwᵗʰstanding our vigilancy and
indeavors for his surprizall, haveing oʳ boates in wᵗʰ the shore and a
small frigᵗ, who gave him chase and fired seavrall guns at him; but
the darknes of the night prevented there long keepeing sight of him,
and, notwᵗʰstanding they made after him to the best of there understanding,
yet he got away and noe sight of him at day light. Last

<p>If the intelligence given me be true, we shall see a sodaine alteration

the towne of Ostend is to be delivered up to yᵉ King of Fraunce by
the Governor and inhabitants of sᵈ place, they being in such a sad
condition by reasone of the extreame burden yᵗ lyes upon them.</p>

<p>For security of performance there is a considerable man, who hath
confirmed the accord wᵗʰ the K. of Fraunce, now wᵗʰ Marshall
d’Aumon, that belongs to Ostend, who hath ingaged his life for performance.
I pray God they faile not in there undertakeings; and,
although treachery be hateful and odious throughout the world, yet
doubtles ’twill prove hapye for our poore traders when such a considerable
place as yᵗ is, a neast of roages, shall be routed. If it
proves efectuall, farwell most pᵗˢ of Flaunders this sumer.</p>

<p>Sʳ, please to keepe this intelligence to yoʳ selfe, least it should

Downes, in search of our fleet. About noone we gote sight of the
Forland, and within one hower after we espied a fleet of shipps on
the back of the Goodwin sand, wᶜʰ we deemed to be our fleet; but,
standing wᵗʰ them, we found them to be the Dutch fleet, consisting
of 70 in 75 sayle. Two ships of the fleet makeing us bore downe
wᵗʰ us, and presantly after two more followed them. We stood away
from them to the eastwards, towards a ship then to leewards, wᶜʰ we
suposed to be a Hollander, but proved a Sweed bound for Burdaix
Light; and, finding two of the men of warr spring there luffs againe
and only 2 bore downe wᵗʰ us, we clapt upon a wind and stood
towards them, haveing gote them about 5 or 6 miles to leewards of
yᵉ body of there fleet. But, when they came wᵗʰin neere shote of
us, they keept there wind, would not come neere to fight us, but
kept fireing guns to windwards and makeing a waft wᵗʰ there
ensignes for more assistance; whereupon 7 or 8 sayle more bore
away wᵗʰ us. Night comeing on, we thought it not convenient to
lye by for them, but stood away for our owne coast, not being able
to keep our lower tire of guns out to windwards, and but 32 brˡˡˢ
powder on bord. Yesterday we got into Alborough bay, when I
gave accᵗ to the Comissʳ at Harwᶜʰ by an expresse from Alborough
of our proceedings, desireing him to send the said letter to yoʳ Honʳ,

alongst wᵗʰ us. The Litle Mary, I understand, will not be ready in
3 or 4 dayes. To conclud, Sonday night proved such a hard galle
of wind yᵗ I iudge the Dutch fleet either drove or bore away towards
there owne coast, for we saw them all under sayle before twas dark.

to sayle out yᵉ Downes, and in company wᵗʰ the Colchester frigᵗᵗ to
plye of of Ostend.</p>

<p>26. The 26 day, Thursday, we sailed out yᵉ Downes, yᵉ wind at
west. We went out at yᵉ North Sand Head, twixt yᵉ Brake and
Goodwin. This noone we spake wᵗʰ the Pembrooke frigᵗᵗ, come
from Harwich cleane tallowed; N.E. from yᵉ north Forland, in 15
fadoms watter, we clapt by under a maine course, intending to drive
all night; but, upon sight of 6 sayle of Holland men of warr, 3 wᵗʰ
there flaggs abroad, to say Admˡˡ Vice and Rear Admirall, we stood
with them. Yᵉ Pembrooke haveing espied them before us, though
bound into yᵉ Downes, bore away on the back of the Goodwin
towards them; comeing up with them, first fired at yᵉ Admˡˢ flagg,
but was not struck. Upon wᶜʰ yᵉ Comandʳ of the Pembrooke sent
his boats on bord to know yᵉ reason of itt. Whilst they were in
dispute, we, comeing in shote, fired at yᵉ Admˡˡˢ flagg alsoe, and
presantly after they sent up a man to topmasthead and struck the
flagg, wᶜʰ his Vice and Reare Admˡˡ did the like. Then we bore
under his lee ahead of him, and hayld him and stood asterne, and,

hang as a waft for about ½ an hower, and afterwards furld them; the

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">My deare Betty</span>,</p>

<p>The 18th instant, wᶜʰ was Satuarday last, I wrote the by one of
the yachts, and as thou advised. Yᵉ next day we saw the Dutch
fleet. We drew ours into a lyne of bataile, the French leading, we
in the reare, all prepared to fight, haveing stav’d and heft over bord
all ours, and I think all the cabins of the whole fleet. The Hollanders
stood over for yᵉ Flaunders Banks and yᵉ Weelings. About
7 at night we were up wᵗʰ them in a lyne, as they lay in the same
posture very orderly to recᵉ us; but, finding it would have bine
darke before we could have well began with them, being about 4 or
5 miles to leewards of us, yᵉ wind at W.S.W., we thought it not
convenient to ingage them. Yᵉ night following, upon there tacking
of, we tackt in yᵉ reare, yᵉ whole fleet following to keep them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
leewards of us, as we did yᵗ night by our twice tacking againe.
Yesterday morning it proved a very thick fogge. We wᵗʰ our
division anchored, standing in wᵗʰ the Banks of Flaunders of Oostend.
About 10 in yᵉ morning, upon cleareing up, we wayed anchor, yᵉ
Dutch fleet 3 miles to leewards of us. We stood of and mett our
fleet standing in. Yᵉ Dutch stood of wᵗʰ us. This day it proved
much wind, that we could not fight them; whereupon we stood in
to our shore N.W., and about ½ seas over we anchored all night.
This morneing we saw yᵉ fleet again. We stood of towards them,
expecting they would have stood wᵗʰ us; but they stood of intending
to draw us over amongst those shoulds, to fight them there. We
keeping our wind, and they bearing away, as we suposed, from yᵉ
wind, we lost sight of them. It blowing hard we tackt, and now
come neare to Sowle Bay, where I supose we may stay a day or two
to watter our fleet.</p>

<p>This day came into us the Katherine, Princes, and Advice, wᵗʰ 2
fire ships more; soe yᵗ I supose we are neerer 90 then fowerscore
men of warr, upwards 25 fireships, amongst wᶜʰ my unckle R. H. is
come. The Dutch fleet not soe many men of warr as we, I beleive,
by 8 or 10 saile, many small vessells and fire ships. Had it pleased
God yesterday to have given us faire weather, God assisting, we
had given a good accᵗ of oʳ actions; our men briske and brave and
very ready and willing to fight. The Earle of Bristow<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> on bord wᵗʰ

<h3><span class="smcap">Copy of Captain Richard Haddock’s</span><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> <span class="smcap">Account, given
his Royal Highness the Duke of York, of their
Engagement, May 28th, 1672, in the Royal James.</span></h3>

<p>In obedience to your Royal Highness’s commands, I here humbly
present to your view a brief narrative of our actions on board the
Royal James, the 28th May last past, as followeth:</p>

<p>Upon signal from our scouts of the Dutch fleet’s approach
(betwixt 3 and 4, the wind E. by S.), we put our ships immediately
into a fighting posture, brought our cable to the capston, and heaft
a peak of our anchor, which, upon firing a gun and loosing foretop-sail
of your Royal Highness’s ship, we presently weighed, and afterwards
lay kedging with our headsails at the mast till our anchor was
up; which done (steered N.E. by N.), we made sail and stood off,
with our signal abroad for the squadron<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> to draw into their line of
battle, which was done as well as the short time we had would
permit. But, finding myself one of the weathermost ships, I bore
to leeward till I had brought ourselves in a line; the Vice Admiral
and part of his division right a head, the Rear Admˡ and his right
astern; only two or three frigates to leeward, and so near, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
them within call. The Dutch squadron, Van Ghent, attacked us in
the body and rear very smartly, and let the van go ahead sometime
without engaging them, so far as I could perceive. We engaged
about an hour and an half very smartly. When the Dutch found
that they could do no good on us with their men of war, they
attacked us with two fire ships, the first of which we fired with our
shott, the second disabled by shooting down his yards. Before
which time I had sent our barge, by my Lord’s<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> command, ahead
to Sir Joseph Jordaine,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> to tack, and with his division to weather
the Dutch that were upon us and beat them down to leeward of us,
and come to our assistance. Our pinnace I sent likewise astern
(both coxswains living) to command our ships to come to our assistance;
which never returned, but were on board several who endeavoured
it but could not effect it.</p>

<p>About two hours after we engaged we were boarded athwart
hawse by one of their men of war, notwithstanding our endeavours
to prevent him by wearing our ship two or three points from the
wind to have taken him alongside. When he had been athwart our
hawse some short time, my Lord would have had me boarded him
with our men and taken him, which I refused to do by giving him
my reason that it would be very disadvantageous to us: first, that I
must have commanded our men from our guns, having then I believe
300 men killed and wounded, and could not expect but to lose 100
in taking him; secondly, had we so done, we could not have cut
him loose from us, by reason the tide of flood bound him fast;
and, thirdly, had we plyed our guns slowly by taking away our
men, we had given cause to the enemy to believe we had been
disabled, and consequently more of them would have boarded us,
which might possibly have overpressed us, and would have been
more dishonour to have lost her by that means than being at last
burnt;&mdash;so that my Lord was satisfied with my reasons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
resolved we should cuff it out to the last man, still in expectation of
assistance.</p>

<p>About 10 o’clock Van Ghent himself, finding those his other flags
could do no good upon us, nor the party with them, came up with
us himself, we having lost the conduct of our ship. He ranged along
our side, gave us a smart volley of small shot and his broadside,
which we returned to him with our middle and lower tier, our upper
guns almost all disabled, the men killed at them. He passed ahead
of us and brought his ship too to leeward, and there lay till I was
gone off the deck.</p>

<p>Some short time after, Sir Joseph Jordaine (our barge having
been with him and given him my Lord’s commands) passed by us
very unkindly to windward, with how many followers of his division
I remember not, and took no notice at all of us; which made me call
to mind his saying to your Royal Highness, when he received his
commission, that he would stand betwixt you and danger; which I
gave my Lord account of, and did beleive by his acting yourself
might be, in his view, in greater danger than we, which made my
Lord answer me: “We must do our best to defend ourselves alone.”</p>

<p>About 12 o’clock I was shot in the foot with a small shot, I supposed
out of Van Ghent’s main top, which pressed me after a small
time to go down to be dressed. I gave my Lord account of it, and
resolved to go up again as soon as was dressed. In the mean time,
when I went off the deck, sent up both Sir Charles<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> and Lieutenant
Mayo<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> to stand by my Lord; and, as soon as I came down, remembring
the flood was done, sent up to my Lord to desire him to
command the ship to anchor by the stern, which was immediately
done; and, after we had brought up, the ship athwart our hawse fell
away, and being entangled with our rigging our men boarded and
took her, cut her loose from us, and, at my Lord’s command,
returned all aboard again. Upon which I, hearing the ship was
loose, sent up to my Lord that the cable might be cut and the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
brought to sail before the wind, and loose our mainsail; which was
presently done. Then my Lord sent me his thanks for my advice,
and withall doubted not but to save the ship. At that time the
surgeon was cutting off the shattered flesh and tendons of my toe;
and immediately after we were boarded by the fatal fire ship that
burnt us.</p>

warr and 20 fire ships, as the Dutch prisoners informe us. We set
upon them in the Schoon Velt, the wind at W.N.Wᵗ., but changed
to yᵉ N.N.E. in the bataile towards evening. We buoyed the outward
banks wᵗʰ our smacks and ketches, and had a smart brush with
them from 12 at noone as long as daylight lasted. The damage we
have done them we certainly know not. Severall of ther ships we
disabled, wᶜʰ we forced into leewards. Trump, whose squadron we
ingaged wᵗʰ ours, shifted his ship once, if not twice. What number
of men we have lost in the fleet not yet know; I believe not 500.
In our ship not above 20, as I can learne; some mortality wounded,
others dismembred. Amongst our dead men is poore Capt. Wasey,
who first lost his arme close to his shoulder, and about 6 howers
after dyed of his wounds. My brother Joseph very well; was wᵗʰ
me last night after yᵉ bataile. My unckle Richard very well: he
hath burnt his ship; was faire to burne De Rutter within his length,
when they shote his masts about his eares; for wᶜʰ indeavoured
service yᵉ Prince<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> hath given him one hundred pounds, and gratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
also his oficers, &amp;c. I supose we shall not atacque them in that
place againe. Our greatest care was to keepe cleere of the sands in
that narrow hole. Our ship, so tender with a saile that we fought
wᵗʰ the watter some tymes comeing into our lower tire of ports,
wᶜʰ was very disadvantagious, could not do that service intended
by us.</p>

<p>There is severall Capᵗˢ killed that we have already an account of;
I hope no more. Capt. Finch in the Yorke, Capt. Tempest in the
Sweepestakes, Capt. Fowles in the Lyon; and Capt. Werden, in the
Heneretta, mortality wounded.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> We have severall of our ships
shattered, not above two disabled, and none, as I heare of, lost, but
2 or 2 fire ships burnt.</p>

<p>We ride now wᵗʰin 3 leagues of the Dutch fleete; they ride in
the place we atacqued them in, and we in our former birth, only
about 2 leagues further of the shore. How soone we shall fight
them againe cannot resolve, but in yᵉ place they now ride I iudge
we shall not atacque them a second tyme. I beleive the Prince may
shift his ship and goe into some other; but of yᵗ in my next.</p>

<p>I desire that thanks and prayes may be returned to Almighty
God for his preservation of me. My humble duty to my deare
mother; loving saluts to my brothers and sisters, and all my deare
relations. God in mercy blesse and preserve them all, and send us
a joyfull meeteing. Wᵗʰ my intire love and saluts to thee wᵗʰ my

<p>May 11. This Sonday morneing, about 7 aclock, we anchored in
the Prince’s fleet, to the westwards of them, about 2 leagues to the
westwards of Dongenesse, in 1 fadom watter, yᵉ lighthouse beareing
N.E. by E. This day I went on bord the St. Michell to waite on
yᵉ Prince, who comanded me to weigh and plye up to his ship;
but, bloweing so hard, could not.</p>

<p>12. This Monday morneing wind at N.E. and N.E. by N.; blew
very hard, and raine some part of the forenoone; could not weigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>13. This Tuesday morneing, yᵉ wind at north, we wayed and gote
up to the Prince’s ship, the St. Michel; anchored alongst her side
without her. This forenoone his Highnes Prince Rupert came on
bord us, but went of at noone; dyned on bord the R. Prince; after
diner returned on bord us. This day we tooke on bord all the
Prince’s retenue and goods, &amp;c.; struck downe some of our gunns
into hold, to recᵉ new ones in ther roomes. All this afternoone yᵉ
wind at north; constant rain.</p>

<p>14. This Wedensday we tooke on bord seaverall of the new gunns
and mounted them. The wind this day came round from the N.W.
to S.Wᵗ., S.E. and E. by Nᵒ. This day the French fleet apeared in
sight about noone; being litle wind, they anchored short of us about
3 leagues.</p>

<p>15. This Thursday we mounted all the rest of the new gunns;
the wind at N.Eᵗ. to E.N.E. Yᵉ French fleet wayed and plyed
towards us; anchored about 4 miles short of us.</p>

<p>16. This Fryday morneing the French fleet weighed and plyed up
to us. About 9 a clock this morneing Monsʳ Conte d’Estrees,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> ther
Admˡˡ, who wore his flagg at yᵉ foretopmast head, being V. Admˡˡ
of Fraunce, past by us about musket shote or somewᵗ more asterne
of us; struck his flagg, lored his topsailes and saluted us, I meane yᵉ
Prince, wᵗʰ 13 peece of ordnance; we returned him eleven in answer.
Presantly after Monsʳ Conte d’Estrees came on bord us, to waite on
his Highnes yᵉ Prince. This evening came of from Rye his Majᵗʸ and
R. Highnes in there yachts; came on bord us; stayed about one hower
and a halfe, and then returned to the yachts againe after 8 at night.</p>

<p>17. This Satuarday morneing, the wind at N. by E., blowing very
fresh, the Prince went on bord the Cleeveland yacht to waite upon
his Majᵗʸ; and about ½ an hower after the King, Duke, and Prince
came on bord this ship. This forenoone we spread a standard in the
mizen shrowds, fired a gunn to call on bord us the flagg oficers.
This day the King and Duke dyned on bord us. The wind hath
blowne very hard at N.N.E. and N.E. by N. all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>18. This Sonday the wind vered to the east and by north, and
back to yᵉ N.N.Eᵗ. at night; blew very fresh all day. This day the
King dyned on bord Conte d’Estrees; the standard at maine topmast
head; his flagg struck wᶜʰ he wore at the foretopmast head.
This evening the King and Duke supt on bord us, and at 9 aclock
tooke ther leaves of us and went on shore to Rye. This day the
noble Lord Ossory<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> hoysted the Reare Admˡˡ blew flagg on bord the
St. Michael.</p>

<p>19. This Monday morning, about 3 aclock, being at anchor still,
the wind at E.N.Eᵗ., we designed to weigh, but, bloweing fresh, we
rode fast all this day.</p>

<p>20. This Tuesday, at 3 in the morneing, being alaramed by
seavrall gunns from the eastwards, we fired a gunn and put out a
light in the mainetopmast shrowds, our signall of weighing, but did
not weigh by reason of the ebb tyde, the wind being at S.Eᵗ. We
had intelligence, by a sloop, of 70 saile of Hollanders seene on the
back of yᵉ Goodwin, and wᵗʰout the Sᵒ Sands Head; but proved to
be, by our 2d intelligence by the litle Greyhound, a fleet of Hamburghers
of 26 saile only. This forenoone we weighed with all the
fleet; stood to the southwards; at noone tackt; litle wind. We
anchored about 2 aclock, yᵉ Nesse light howse N. by E., in 21 fadoms,
7 miles distance. This day his Highnes the Prince dyned on bord
the Conte d’Estrees, who struck his flagg as soone as the Prince was
on bord him, and the Prince’s Jack flagg hoysted up at mainetopmast
head; and, whilst the Prince remaind on bord him, his flagg
(I meane yᵉ Conte d’Estrees) was kept furld. Towards evening the
Hamburgʳˢ fleet plyed by us to the wᵗwards; gave us many gunns
in saluts. Yᵉ wind, since 4 in the afternoone, at W.S.W. and Wᵗ.
This night we rode fast.</p>

<p>21. This 21 day, Wedensday morneing, at 4 aclock, we wayed
wᵗʰ the whole fleet; wind at W. by Nᵒ., a fine fresh gale. By 10
aclock the wind came to yᵉ S.Wᵗ. We steered away on the back of
the Goodwin. About 4, afternoone, we anchored in 10 fadom watter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on the flatts of the Nᵒ Forland, the lighthouse beareing W. by S.
southerly, about 6 miles distant.</p>

<p>22. This Thursday morneing we wayed by 5 aclock; steered
away E. by Nᵒ. and E.N.Eᵗ. to goe cleare of the showld of the Falls;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
the wind at S.W., a fine gale. After we had gote without ye Falls,
we hauled up E. b. S. and E.S.E.; a fresh gale at S.W. About 4
in the afternoone we made the coast of Flaunders. At 6, evening,
we anchored in 15 fadoms watter, Oostend spire steeples beareing
S.E. by Sᵒ, 5 leagues distant. This evening we saw the Dutch fleet,
part of them; they rode in Schonvelt. Our scout gave us accᵗ they
were but 86 saile, the outside, small and great. They wayed and
turned up amongst yᵉ bancks towards the Weelings.</p>

<p>23. This Fryday morneing, by 6 aclock, yᵉ flood being done, we
wayed; wind at S.S.W., litle wind. We stood in; drew our ships
into a lyne of batayle. Our squadron ledd the van, the French in
the midle, and yᵉ blew squadron in the reare. We sayled and drove
soe farr to the N.E. wards that we brought Oostend steeples south
easterly, about 5 leagues or six leagues of. Anchored in 11 fadom
watter, within the oyster bancks. Yᵉ Dutch fleet, yᵉ nᵒmost, bore
E.N.E.; and yᵉ southmost Eᵗ, southerly from us, about 3 leagues.
This night have had but litle wind at S.S.W. and S.Wᵗ.</p>

<p>24. This Satuarday morneing we intended, if the should watter
hindred not, to goe in wᵗʰ our fleet and set upon the Dutch; sending
a party of 35 men of warr, 13 fire ships, and 24 tendors ahead of
us, to make the onsett, and we wᵗʰ the whole fleet to have seconded
them. But this our intention was this day prevented by God
Almighty’s providence, the wind bloweing very hard at S.W. and
Wᵗ.S.Wᵗ. This morneing came in to the fleet the Soveraigne,
Victory, and Dyamond, out of the river of Thames. Yesterday our
scouts gave us accᵗ that yᵉ Dutch fleet, of all sorts that could be told,
did not exceed 84. All this day the wind hath blowne very hard
at S.W. and W.S.W.; forct us strick our yard, and some ships both
topmast and yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>25. This Sonday the wind hath blowne very hard at W.S.Wᵗ.;
forct us in yᵉ afternoone to strick our topmasts and get our sprit-saile
yard under the boltsprit. This day severall of the French
ships broke from ther ground tackle, but brought up againe wᵗʰ
other anchors and rode fast.</p>

<p>26. This Monday, in the forenoon, the wind continued bloweing
hard at W.S.W., as did also the night past, but not so violently as
the day formerly. In the afternoone the wind dullered. We sett
our topmasts and got up oʳ yards; our neighbours the Dutch did
the like also. Toward evening indiferent faire weather.</p>

<p>27. This Tuesday the wind hath bine from the S.Wᵗ. back to yᵉ
S.Eᵗ., wᵗʰ very thick weather, and then veered to the N.Wᵗ., wᵗʰ
some tymes very thick [weather] and raine and wind; all this day
very unconstant weather. This afternoone we spread our red flagg
for the severall divissions drawne out of the fleet to get themselves
into a body for the first onsett upon the enemy; but did not weigh
ourselves. Our party out of our squadron anchored to leewards of
us, and neere half way betweene yᵉ Dutch fleet and ours. This day
yᵉ standard was spread for the flagg oficers. When come on bord,
twas resolved that tomorrow, about 10 in the morning, the flood
being done and faire weather, that we weigh and atacque the Dutch
fleet now rideing in the Schoonvelt, steereing with an easey saile
upon them; and, in case they go in to Flushing, then to anchor in
their places; and, that they stand of into sea, to stand out with them.</p>

<p>28. This Wedensday morneing, being indiferent faire weather,
we prepared our ship; gote upp our sheat anchor, slung our yards,
&amp;c. The wind at west, a fresh gale. By 10 aclock we gote up our
anchor, and made sayle. Brave weather; wind at W. b. N. and
W.N.Wᵗ. We wᵗʰ our squadron steered N.E. b. E. wᵗʰ the north
end of the Dutch fleet, yᵉ French wᵗʰ the body, and yᵉ blew squadron
wᵗʰ the south part of them. To 11 aclock thay rode most of them
fast at anchor, not so much as ther fore topsailes loose. About 12
at noone we bore downe upon the Dutch and ingaged ther van, and
the French in the body, our blew squadron in the reare. We fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
till twas darke, tacking to and againe in the Schoon Velt. What
certaine damage we did the enemy we cannot tell. This night we
sailed and drove out againe; came into 6 fadom watter on yᵉ oyster
banck. By day light we were gote 3 leagues without the Schoon
Velt.</p>

<p>29. This Thursday morneing we anchored in 13 fadom watter by
our judgement, S. b. Eᵗ. from Oostend, 6 or 7 leagues of. This day
yᵉ Prince called a councill of flagg oficers. Ordered, that yᵉ
respective flaggs call ther divissions on bord and take accᵗ of what
damages recᵈ yesterday in the bataile. This day the wind blew very
hard at S.Wᵗ.; forct us to strick our topmasts and yards and veere
out our shot of cable 2½ without bord. This afternoone, about 3
aclock, the Prince sent away a packet for Whitehall, by whome I
wrote for London.</p>

<p>30. This Fryday the wind blew very hard, most part of the day,
at S.Wᵗ. and W.S.Wᵗ. Towards evening lesse wind. We got up
our topmasts.</p>

<p>31. This Satuarday forenoone, foggy weather; afternoone, very
faire weather; the wind at N.Eᵗ. This day the Prince tooke resolution
to shift shipps, ours being so tender that we could not beare
out our lower tire of gunns in the late bataile.</p>

<p>June 1. This Sonday, yᵉ first day of June, the Dutch fleet many
of them were under saile, but came not out to us. We gote up our
anchor and came to saile wᵗʰ all the fleet, but anchored againe and
birth’t our selves in our anchoring posture agreed on, to say: the
flaggs to ride N. and south of each other, 4 cables length distant;
and the ships of the severall divissions to ride N.W. and S.E. from
there flaggs, 2 cable length distant of one side and the other; the
flagg ships as they are ranged in ther line of bataile. This day we
struck some broken gunns down into hold, and some whole, to the
number of tenn, to stiffen our ship if posible.</p>

<p>2. This Monday the wind blowes very fresh at N.E., and did so
all the last night and the day before. This day the Prince resolved
to shift his ship and goe on bord the R. Soveraigne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>3. This Tuesday evening his Highnes the Prince went on bord
the Soveraigne. I and Capt. Young<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> followed him, and this night
lay on bord her.</p>

<p>4. This Wedensday morneing, very early, I went on bord the
R. Charles to shift the men. Chose out 250 men to come on bord
the Soveraigne.</p>

<p>This 4th day of June, Wedensday, before noone, the Dutch fleet,
then rideing in Schoonvelt, all wayed and came to saile and came
out to us. We wayed with our fleet; put ourselves in the best

squadron, leaveing most of the French in the reare, with our Vice
Admirall. Betwixt 4 and 5 aclock the Dutch fleet&mdash;Trump in the

N.Eᵗ., a very fresh gale). We ingaged till twas darke, more then
½ range of our shot distant. We kept our lufe; they did likewise
the same; would not come close to us. What damage we did them
we know not. On our parts we lost 2 fire ships; shatterd our ships,

<p>My last, of the 7ᵗʰ Augᵗ from Visagapatam, gave yoʳ Honʳ accᵗ
of our arrivall Madras and of our affaires to that tyme. The 10ᵗʰ
Augᵗ we saild thence for Balasore, wher we arriv’d the 15ᵗʰ; in wᶜʰ
bay we have contᵈ and rid out the monsoone, wᶜʰ has prov’d favourabler
then expected (beinge leape yeare).</p>

<p>The 15ᵗʰ 7ber Capᵗ Heath arriv’d this place, who, by virtue of
the President and Counsell of Madras order requir’d my goeinge
up wᵗʰ hime to Chuttynutte<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> in the river of Hugly (the place
where our Agent and factorie resided), myselfe wᵗʰ the rest of the
comandʳˢ of the Europe Shipps then in the river to assist hime in
the Rᵗ Honᵇˡᵉ Compˢ affairs.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> In fews days after our getting up to
Chuttynutte, a letter was writ to the Nabob of Dacca (the cheife
govenʳ of that citty), who had formerly requested our Agent that
if we would assist hime wᵗʰ ships to transport soulders and horss
from Chottagam to Arraccan (they beinge in warrs wᵗʰ that Kinge),
he would give us his Pharwanna<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> of a settlemᵗ of trade, wᵗʰ prevaledges
as formerly accordinge to the 12 articles formerly sent hime
from our agent &amp;c. Capt. Heath, in the letter sent, condesended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the Nabob’s request, in suplyinge hime wᵗʰ 10 ships and vessells for
the Mogull’s occations, to transport ther soulders and horss, provided
they would allow of the buildinge of a fortyfiction wᵗʰin the
river of Hugly, for the better security of the Rᵗ Honᵇˡᵉ Compˢ
estate and serᵗˢ; wᵗʰout wᶜʰ grant of a fortyfied place the Compˢ
ordʳˢ possitive are, to wᵗʰdraw off all our factory from this place.</p>

<p>We continued heere 5 weeks for the Nabob’s answer to the
proposall: but not comeing, we, haveinge taken off all the Honᵇˡᵉ
Compˢ concernes from the shoare, saild from Chuttynᵗʸ the 8ᵗʰ 9ber,
and passed by ther fortts peaceably. At our arrival Balasore found
that the govenʳ of the towne had (some tyme before our comeinge)
detaind the Rᵗ Honᵇˡᵉ Compˢ goods, beinge this yeares investmᵗˢ,
alsoe partic. mens goods; and would not permit none of the factors,
nor our people that were ashoure buying provit[ions], to come off.
Capᵗ Heath sent 2 of our factors wᵗʰ a letter to the govenʳ (who was
come downe to the bancksall, or point of sand goeinge into the
river, wher he was makeinge a fortyfication), to demand the Rᵗ
Honbᵉ Compˢ goods wᵗʰ all our men. His answer was, what he
did was by order from the Nabob; and, if he did dilliver our goods
and men, should loose his head. 3 days after, 2 of the factors were
againe sent to aquaint the govenʳ that our intention was to depart
out these parts peaceable, we haveinge come away out Hugly river
wᵗʰout doeinge any act of hostillity to any of the Mogull’s subjects;
therfore requird hime to send off our goods and people by faire
meanes; if not, we would have them by force of armes. Wᶜʰ hee
not permitting them too goe off, the next day all our soulders, about
320, and upwards 240 seamen were put into the small vessels and
all our boates; and early next morninge they landed a mile to the
W.ward of the fort (wᶜʰ the govnʳ had rais’d); against wᶜʰ landinge
place they had planted 5 small guns on a sandhill, wᶜʰ they discharg’d
at our men, and killd 2 and wounded 2 more; soe fled
from the guns. And soone after, the cheife capᵗ of our soulders
had drawne all the soulders and seamen in order of battalia, marcht
up to the fort, wᶜʰ, at ther aproach, fired all ther guns they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
planted to the land; but, soone after, the govenʳ and all his men
fleed out the fort wᵗʰout doeing much harme to our men; the wᶜʰ
we possest wᵗʰout any farther opposition. In and about this fort
they had upwards 40 guns mounted and a good wall made wᵗʰ
timber and clay; might have bine sufficient (if manag’d by
Europeans) to [have] wᵗʰstood a great armie of men, or at least
done much more mischief then they did.</p>

<p>The govenʳ, after deserted his fort, made all hast possable up to
Balasore towne, and orderd the factory house (in wᶜʰ were confind
all our people, thirteene in number) to be sett on fire. Our people
in the house defended themselves bravely, killinge sevˡ of the
Moors; but by the firsness of the fire were forct to surrender themselves
on tearmes to have ther lives and good useage. The next day
Capt. Heath (who went ashoare wᵗʰ the soulders&mdash;Capᵗ Sharpe
comanded the small vessells and boates that were to goe over the
barr, leaveinge mee in comand of the ships in the roade) went up
with all the soulders and seamen to Balasore towne by watter and
landed short of old Balasore fort, the wᶜʰ they soone tooke; soe
marcht into the towne, few or noe people beinge left to oppose
them; the govenʳ disertinge it at ther comeinge, caryinge wᵗʰ hime
all our English, amongst wᶜʰ are 3 of our ships compᵃ, vizᵗ. Mr.
Davenant (beinge ashoare buyinge provit[ions]), Charles Scarlet,
midshipman, and Sam Harbin, gunʳ, serᵗ of Capⁿ Heath’s, his
pursur, and 3 more, Mr. Stanly, cheife of the factory, the rest free
men that trades in the country. As yet we cannot gett the govenʳ
to give ther releasemᵗ. We have sent sevˡ messingers to hime,
that we have not burnt ther towne nor ships, expectinge he would
dilliver up our men; but, if not, we will returne and doe both.
Our soulders (but seamen more espetially) have comitted many
inhuemane actions in the towne, plundringe not only Moors but
sevˡ Portugeese houses, and killed sevˡ innocent people. We have
had the greatest loss in this axtion, vizᵗ. 4 men killd and 3 wounded.
Ther names are: Mr. Starland, 3d mate, Henry Grove, cheife
trumpetter, Christopher Hogg, and Jnᵒ Hinton, who very indiscreetly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
went out wᵗʰ sevˡ more seamen to a garden house, expectinge
great plunder, were cut off, sevˡ of them, by a party of
horss. The 3 wounded are Henʳʸ Roxby, Franˢ Johnson, and
Jnᵒ Smart.</p>

<p>I have, by the Williamson (by whom this is alsoe intended you),
sent Sʳ Henʳʸ Johnson and Sʳ Tho. Rawlinson, and alsoe to my wife,
a list of our dead &amp;cᵃ men, in all 44. Our supernumery men wᶜʰ
I brought out of England, beinge 27, at my arivall Madras, I
aquaintd the President therwᵗʰ, who offred them to Cap. Bromwell,
the Rotchester haveinge lost most of ther men. But he
refuseinge to pay the charge the Honᵇˡᵉ Compᵃ were at sendinge
them out, they were not taken out ther; and what of them that
are alive doe still remaine in our ship, not beinge demanded here
by the agent. I supose our owners will be alowed for them at 50ˢ
per mᵒ, noe longer then our departure Madras, to wᶜʰ tyme we had
lost 30 men. I doe not repent ther continueinge abord, haveinge
had soe great mortolaty and most of them the best of our seamen.</p>

<p>I supose our next enterprize will be towards Chottagam, a place
neere the coast of Arraccan. The Rᵗ Honᵇˡᵉ Compᵃ possative orders
are for endeavouringe the takinge it; but I feare we shall not have
strength sufficient to effect it, the Nabob haveinge sent many thousand
of [men] this yeare ther to over run and take the kingdome of
Arracan. The king of that country beinge some tyme since dead,
part of the people are in rebelion against the present govermᵗ; by
whᶜʰ its supos’d the Mogullers will goe farr in takeing that country
this yeare, and we frustrated of our designe.</p>

<p>Honᵇˡᵉ Sir, I have not writt to any of owners (except the 2 in
charty party), beleivinge we shall returne to Madras before the
Williamson sailes for England. Our ship is in a very good condition
and very thite. I beleive our stay in India will be the extreme of
our tyme, for at present noe prospect of a freight for Europe; and
I feare the brave trade of Bengall will be lost, at whᶜʰ the Dutch
and French rejoyce, that this trade may wholy fall to them.</p>

<p>I have not elce to add; only please to present my duty, respects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

of Bengal for past injuries, and to attempt to seize Chittagong. But before the
arrival of the forces a premature quarrel with the natives forced the English to
abandon Hoogly and retire to Chuttanuttee. In Sept. 1687, a truce was patched up,
but the Company was not satisfied. An armament was despatched under command
of Heath. The result was the attack on Balasore, as told in this letter, an
abortive attempt on Chittagong, and the abandonment of the Company’s factories

<p class="date">Dated on board her Majᵗⁱᵉˢ ship Dorsetshire,

<p class="salutation">Sʳ,</p>

<p>I heare give you an accoᵗ of our good success, especially what
has related to my own particular part. July 21ˢᵗ we anchor’d here
in yᵉ Bay, and about 4 in the afternoon landed about 2000 marrines,
Dutch and all. I commanded yᵉ landing with three captaines
more; all which was don wᵗʰ little opposition. About 40
horse came downe from yᵉ towne, wᶜʰ was all; and they run away
soe soon as our guns began to play upon them. We landed
about 2 miles from the towne, in yᵉ Bay, and march’d directly to
the foot of the hill, were they posted themselves within muskett
shott of the gates; so cutt of all manner of communication from
yᵉ land. We hove into yᵉ towne this evening about 17 shells. The
Prince of Hess<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> landed with us and immediatly sent a summons
to the Governer, wᶜʰ did not returne any answer tell the next
morning, and then the Governer said he would defend the towne
to the very last. Then Admirall Byng, who commanded the cannonading,
began to draw up all his ships in a line before the towne;
but, it proving little wind, could not gett in with them all, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that we did little this day. There was three small ships in the
old mold, one of which annoy’d our camp by fireing amongst them,
having about 10 guns lying close in the mold and just under a
great bastion at yᵉ north corner of the towne. I proposed to Sʳ
George<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> the burning her in the night. He liked itt; accordingly
ordered what boats I would have to my assistance; and about 12
at night I did it effectually, wᵗʰ the loss of but one man and 5 or
6 wounded.</p>

<p>July 23rd. At 4 this morning, Admˡ Byng began with his
ships to cannonade, a Dutch Rear Admˡ with 5 or 6 ships of theirs
along with him; which made a noble noise, being within half shot
of the towne. My ship not being upon service, I desired Sʳ George
to make me his aducon to carry his comands from tyme to tyme to
admirall Byng, which he did accordingly; and after about 2 hours
continuall fireing sent me with orders to forbare. Upon this I
went to every ship in the line wᵗʰ this orders, and coming on board
Capt. Jumper,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> in yᵉ Lenox, found him extraordinary well posted
within muskett shott of the new mold head, and had beat them all
out of yᵉ battery and of the mold, so that I beleived we might attack
it with our boats. I went immediatly and acquainted Admˡ Byng
wᵗʰ it, who ordered all the boats to be man’d and arm’d. From
him I went to Sʳ George and gave him my oppinion that the mold
might be attack’d. He immediatly made the signall for all the
boates in yᵉ fleet, and gave me the command of yᵉ attack, wᵗʰ 3 or
4 captaines along wᵗʰ me. I made all the hast I could with orders
to Admirall Byng to send me accordingly; but some of the boats
got ashore before I could reach them, wᵗʰ little or no opposition.
Severall of our men gott into yᵉ Castle; upon which it blew up.
We had kill’d between 40 and 50 men. Most of all the boates
that landed first were sunk; about 100 or two wounded; upon
which, all yᵗ remain’d came running downe and leap’d into the
water, being so mightyly surprized. I landed within a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
after the accident, and rallied our men. We went over a breach
in the wall but one at a time, and took possesstion of the hill. I
immediatly sent Capt. Roffy<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[e]</a> and Capt. Acton,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> wᵗʰ between 40
and 50 men, and took possesstion of a bastion of 8 guns within less
then half muskett shott of the towne wall: and there we pitch’d
our collours. Soon after, Admˡ Byng came ashore to me and sent
in a drumer wᵗʰ a sommons, who returnd in about 2 hours wᵗʰ a
letter in answer that they would surrender the next day; wᶜʰ they
accordingly did. I beleive I had wᵗʰ me, at the first onsett, between
2 and 300 men; but we grew in a very little time to neare 1000.
This was the manner we took Gibralter, which I hope we shall
maintaine.</p>

<p>I hope, Sʳ, youle excuse this trouble I give, butt, beleiving that
every boddy here rights att this tyme uppon this occation, I could
not forbeare giveing my very good friend Sʳ Ricᵈ this perticuler

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Hon</span>ᵈ Sʳ,</p>

<p>This comes to you by the Faulcon pink, which is sent home
express wᵗʰ the good news of our releiving Barcelona in the greatest
extremity. The French had made preparations for a generall assault
that very day we came; and it must have been infallibly taken, had
we not had the luckiest passage imaginable (being but five days
from Lisbon to Cape Martin, where we joynd Sʳ Jno. Leake).</p>

<p>Saturday last in the morning, when were about 5 leagues to the
wᵗward of Barcelona, my Lord Peterborow came of to the fleet wᵗʰ
twelve hundᵈ soldiers embarqued in felucas and boats, and in the
afternoon got in and landed them, wᵗʰ all the soldiers out of the
transports and most of the marines of the fleet. We have now
about nine thousand soldiers in the towne. The French army consisted
at first of twenty thousand; four of wᶜʰ, horse under the command
of the Duke of Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Their loss during this seige is computed
to be five [thousand] including a thousand sick and wounded
they have left behind, when they raised the seige, wᶜʰ was at twelve
aclock last night. They have left 50 peices of brass cannon
mounted and 15 mortars, and are now bound to Roussilion. They
will find great difficultys on their march. The Miquelets,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> being
very numerous and all in arms, will destroy a great many of ’em
before they get out of Catalonia, it being a close country. The
French squadron before this place consisted of 26 saile, line of battle
ships. They sailed the night before we came, having intelligence
of us by their scouts. They were all the supply the army had for
provisions, for the Catalans have not given them the least; nor
could a man of ’em stirr from his tent a musquet shot out of the
Camp but they killed him. We are now sending four ships with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
6 hundred soldiers for Girone, to reinforce that garrison, lest the
French should make any attempt on it, it lying in their way.</p>

<p>I hear there is an express come to Barcelona from my Lord
Gallaway, giving an account of his being got to Toledo and on his
march for Madrid. The lucky turn Providence has given to our
affairs in these parts I suppose will be joyfull news in England; and
this being the first certain accᵗ you’l have, this long letter wont
seem tedious.</p>

<p>I can expect no letters from you till Sʳ Clowdsly joyne us, and

The said shipp, after a vigorous defence, was burnt by the Dutch;

<p>The Superbe being orderd from the fleet wᵗʰ the Admirall’s letters,

<p>Five days ago we had a battle wᵗʰ the Spanish fleet off of Cape
Passaro,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> on the Island of Sicily, in wᶜʰ severall of their ships were
taken and some destroyd. The Grafton had her share in that action,
and the Admirall has been pleased to make me great compliments
on my behaviour that day. I shall soon be orderd to be refitted at
Port Mahon, the ship requiring it. I had fifty men killd and
wounded. Among the former was Lᵗ Bramble, who was appointed
by the intrest of Sir Cha. Wager. I’m sorry for him, he being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
good officer. My Cousin Haddock<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> chased towards the shoar after
part of the Spanish fleet, when they separated, wᵗʰ 4 or 5 other ships
whose signalls were made for that purpose, and they are not yet
come into the fleet. However, I doubt not but he is well, the ships
that they were sent after being of the smaller sort.</p>

<p>My dʳ, pray send to Mrs. Harris to tell her her spouse is well.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>
He dined aboard me the day after the action; he was one of the
ships engaged.</p>

<p>Just before we saild from Naples I received yʳ letter, and am glad
to hear yʳself and the little boy are well. I give my love to all

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">My dear Spouse</span>,</p>

<p>I send this to tell you I am well. I believe, before this come to
you, you will have heard of my having forced ashoar on Sicily a
Spanish man of war of 70 guns, wᶜʰ is overset and sunk. I recᵈ
some shot from her, but without much damage. My dʳ, we are here
at an anchor, in company wᵗʰ the Kent, Royˡ Oake, and Rochester,
to block up Camock,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> who is at Messina and will not venture out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his squadron being much inferiour to us. By the news we receive
from England, I conjecture Spain will soon be oblidgd to accept the
terms proposed to ’em; after wᶜʰ I suppose the bigger ships will be
orderd home, where I shall always be glad to be, whenever it consists
wᵗʰ my honour; for, indeed, my dear Fanny, I heartily love you.</p>

He slipped out in a frigate, which however he had to abandon, and escaped by boat
to land. He was an Irishman who had served with distinction in the English navy
under Queen Anne, but had been dismissed on account of his Jacobite tendencies.
He then entered the Spanish service; and it is said that, if the Spanish Admiral
had followed his advice, the battle off Cape Passaro might have had a different
result.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
